# MedBot: AI Medical Assistant

## Description

This project implements an AI-powered medical assistant, "MedBot," featuring:

1.  **Disease Prediction:** Uses a `SetFit` model fine-tuned on a disease dataset to predict potential conditions based on user-provided symptoms.
2.  **Information Retrieval:** Leverages the Groq API with a large language model (LLM) to fetch general treatment and prevention information for the predicted disease.
3.  **Conversational AI:** Includes a Streamlit-based chat interface allowing users to interact with MedBot (powered by Groq) for general health inquiries.

The system comprises a Jupyter Notebook (`DiseasePrediction.ipynb`) for model training and interactive testing, and a Streamlit application (`app.py`) for the user interface.

**Disclaimer:** This tool provides AI-generated information and predictions for informational purposes only. It is **not** a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider.

## Features

* Predict potential diseases based on symptom descriptions using a fine-tuned SetFit model.
* Retrieve general treatment and prevention information for predicted diseases using the Groq LLM.
* Engage in conversational interactions about general health topics via a Streamlit chatbot powered by Groq.
* Separate notebook for model training, evaluation, and saving.
* User-friendly web interface using Streamlit.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* A dataset file (e.g., `final_diseases_dataset.xlsx`) with columns like 'Disease Name', 'Overview/Definition', 'Symptoms', 'Causes/Risk Factors' for training the SetFit model.
* Groq API Key. Get one from [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)

You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl setfit sentence-transformers datasets joblib torch groq streamlit scikit-learn

(Note: scikit-learn is used for train_test_split within the notebook).
Setup & Configuration
1.	Clone the Repository: 
Bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
2.	Install Dependencies: 
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # (Create a requirements.txt file if needed)
Or install manually using the command in the Requirements section.
3.	Dataset: Place your disease dataset (e.g., final_diseases_dataset.xlsx) in a location accessible by the training script (DiseasePrediction.ipynb). Update the file_path variable within the notebook accordingly.
4.	Groq API Key: 
o	Set the GROQ_API_KEY environment variable.
o	Alternatively, for the Streamlit app, you can set it as an environment variable or use Streamlit secrets ([groq] GROQ_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY').
5.	Model Paths: 
o	In DiseasePrediction.ipynb, configure model_save_path and label_mapping_save_path to your desired locations.
o	In app.py, update SETFIT_MODEL_PATH and LABEL_MAPPING_PATH to point to the directories/files where the trained SetFit model and label mapping will be saved by the notebook (or are saved, if already trained). Ensure these paths match between the notebook and the app.
Usage
1. Training the Disease Prediction Model
•	Open and run the DiseasePrediction.ipynb notebook.
•	Ensure the dataset path (file_path) and Groq API key (within the notebook or as env variable) are correctly set.
•	The notebook will: 
o	Load and preprocess the data.
o	Train the SetFit model.
o	Save the trained model artifacts (setfit_disease_model directory) and the label mapping (disease_label_mapping.pkl) to the paths specified in the configuration section of the notebook.
•	You only need to run the training part once unless you want to retrain the model. The notebook includes logic to skip training if model artifacts are found.
2. Running the MedBot Streamlit Application
•	Make sure you have trained the model and the saved artifacts (setfit_disease_model, disease_label_mapping.pkl) exist at the locations specified in app.py (SETFIT_MODEL_PATH, LABEL_MAPPING_PATH).
•	Ensure your GROQ_API_KEY is accessible (environment variable or Streamlit secrets).
•	Run the Streamlit app from your terminal: 
Bash
streamlit run app.py
•	The application will launch in your web browser, providing the disease prediction tool and the MedBot chat interface.
